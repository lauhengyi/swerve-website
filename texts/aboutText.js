      `Our mission is to help brick and mortar stores remain competitive, and break 
        into the online shopping market. Swerve aims to do this by providing shop owners with a more 
        seamless and accessible way to do digital advertising, as well as to make it more convenient 
        for consumers to find the products they want from physical stores.`,

      `Our concept involves creating a platform for merchants to upload a digital catalogue of 
        their products, as well as to broadcast promotions to consumer. Consumers can search for 
        products listed on the catalogues using our search engine, to find the best deals, or to 
        find the store nearest to them. Consumers can even follow their favourite stores to stay 
        up to date with new product releases and promotions.`,
